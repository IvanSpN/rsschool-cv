## Brief information about yourself:

I'm a beginner front-end web developer. At the moment I don't have much experience and skills, but I have a great desire to learn. I am very motivated! Courses from the RS School are a real gift of fate for me, it is very difficult to study, but at the same time very interesting. I will do my best to become a top notch front-end developer!
